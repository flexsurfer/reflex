# Roadmap: AI-Development Must-Haves

Prioritized improvements for [reflex](https://github.com/flexsurfer/reflex) and [reflex-devtools](https://github.com/flexsurfer/reflex-devtools), ordered by impact. Items marked **(pairs with …)** need coordinated changes across both repos.

Context: reflex's architecture (ID-indexed events/subs, pure handlers, effects isolation) already lets an AI agent work on a large app with minimal context — the `*-ids.ts` files act as an index, exact-match grep gives retrieval, and pure handlers bound verification to a single function. The items below close the remaining gaps: React-binding correctness, runtime performance at scale, compiler feedback, a closed observe→act→verify loop against the running app, and token-frugal runtime inspection.

## Reflex (lib)

### P0 — Correctness (React binding & memory)

- [x] **Rewrite `useSubscription` on `useSyncExternalStore`.** *(done — hook keyed on serialized subVector; `Reaction.getSnapshot()` with external-store semantics; `watch()` refreshes stale caches on the not-alive→alive transition; react peer dep bumped to >=18)*
  The current `useState` + `useEffect` binding (`src/hook.ts`) has three defects, all fixed by one rewrite keyed on the serialized subVector:
  1. *Parameter changes are ignored* — `useEffect(..., [])` captures the subVector on first mount forever; `useSubscription([SUB_IDS.TODO_BY_ID, props.id])` keeps returning data for the original `id` after the prop changes. Silent stale data; only workaround is `key`-forced remount.
  2. *Missed updates between render and subscribe* — the initial value is read during render but `watch()` happens in the effect, and `watch` neither pushes the current value nor re-checks versions. Events landing in that window leave the component stale until the next change.
  3. *Tearing exposure* under React 18 concurrent rendering.

- [x] **Prune the reaction registry on dispose.** *(done — reactions deregister on dispose; on revival they re-resolve deps through the registry and re-register, so live reactions are always the registered instances the db wake-up path can find. Also covers aborted renders: reactions created during a render that never commits are marked provisional and swept after a self-scheduled grace cycle — the sweep schedules itself from `markProvisionalReaction`, independent of db updates, so idle apps clean up too; sweeping is safe because a late subscriber recreates through `getOrCreateReaction`. Non-JSON-serializable subscription params (at any nesting depth) warn once per sub id in dev, validated before the cache lookup so colliding keys can't dodge the warning.)*

- [ ] **Cross-subscription render consistency (known, deferred).**
  Between an event's commit and the rAF flush, alive reactions serve pre-event values while a newly mounting component's dormant reaction refreshes against the post-event db — a one-frame mixed-version window that self-heals at flush (pre-existing property, not introduced by the uSES rewrite; the old hook read fresh at mount too). Real fix is a db generation counter serving all snapshots from the last flushed generation — do it together with the flush-scheduling rework (see background-tab item in P1).

### P0 — DX & AI feedback loop

- [x] **Typed event/sub payload maps.** *(done — augmentable `EventPayloads` (id → params tuple), `SubPayloads` (id → `{ params; result }`), `EffectPayloads` (id → payload), and `AppDb` (db shape) interfaces in `src/types.ts`; apps opt in via `declare module '@flexsurfer/reflex'`. Once augmented, `dispatch`/`debounceAndDispatch`/`throttleAndDispatch` accept only declared ids with matching payloads; effect tuples returned from handlers are checked against `EffectPayloads`, with the built-in `dispatch`/`dispatch-later` effects always included, reserved against accidental `EffectPayloads` overrides, and their event vectors checked against `EventPayloads` — closing the indirect-dispatch hole (a partial "check only dispatch effects, leave others loose" design is unsound: the loose union member `[string, any?]` subsumes the strict one, so strict effects require declaring them all); `regEffect` infers the handler value param; `regEvent` infers handler params for declared ids, gets a typed `draftDb` from `AppDb` with no generics (the explicit db generic `regEvent<MyDb>(...)` suppresses param inference — augmenting `AppDb` removes the need for it; inline coeffects annotation also works), and stays permissive for undeclared ids; `useSubscription`/`getSubscriptionValue` check params and infer results; `regSub` checks the computeFn return type; `initAppDb` checks the initial state (via a `NoInfer` guard so the argument doesn't defeat the default) and `getAppDb` returns the augmented shape. Unaugmented maps keep the API exactly as before — verified by the untouched jest suite compiling with type-check on. Compile-time contract locked in by two tsc fixtures: `tests/types/` against src (`npm run test:types`) and `tests/types/dist/` against the built `dist/index.d.ts` resolved as `@flexsurfer/reflex` (`npm run test:types:dist`, runs after build in `prepublishOnly`) — the dist fixture guards that tsup's dts rollup keeps the interfaces declared in the entry module, which is what makes package-name augmentation merge. Docs: README section + llms.txt §12.)*
  The one real architectural weakness vs Redux Toolkit: `dispatch([EVENT_IDS.X, payload])` payloads aren't checked against handler signatures. Let apps declare a payload map and type `dispatch`, `regEvent`, and `useSubscription` against it:

  ```ts
  interface EventPayloads {
    'todos/add': [title: string];
    'todos/toggle': [id: TodoId];
  }
  ```

  Gives humans autocomplete, gives AI compile-error feedback loops (the cheapest verification signal there is), and doubles as a machine-readable API manifest. Must be opt-in — the current untyped API keeps working.

- [x] **Route handler errors into the trace pipeline.** *(done — `interceptor.execute` merges a JSON-serializable `tags.error` into the event's trace on both error paths (with and without a registered error handler), so any custom error handler still gets traced failures; dispatching an unregistered event id now also emits a trace with `tags.error` instead of vanishing; effect handlers that throw are collected into `tags.effectErrors` on the event's trace from `doFxInterceptor`. All entries share one normalized schema (exported as `TraceErrorTag`): `{ phase: 'missing-handler' | 'handler' | 'effect', message, stack?, interceptor?, direction?, effect?, eventV? }` — `tags.error` means the event failed, `tags.effectErrors` means the event committed but effects failed, so devtools P0 (dispatch outcome) can derive the outcome from the tags alone. Queue purges are loudly reported: the router logs which event threw plus the ids of every pending event dropped.)*
  Today `defaultErrorHandler` (`src/events.ts`) logs and rethrows; the trace for a failed event carries no error info. Attach the error (event vector, interceptor id, message, stack) to trace tags so devtools/MCP can surface failures. Without this, nothing downstream can report why an event didn't do what was expected. Related: an event exception currently purges the entire pending queue (`src/router.ts`) — at minimum this should be loudly reported.

### P1 — Performance at scale

- [ ] **Make patch generation conditional; use a shallow top-level diff for root wake-up.**
  `enablePatches()` runs at module load and every event uses `produceWithPatches` (`src/events.ts`) — patch generation and auto-freeze run in production with tracing off. Patches are only needed by devtools; the root-key wake-up (`src/db.ts`) can be a near-free shallow ref diff of top-level keys (`old[k] !== new[k]`). Use plain `produce` when tracing is disabled.
  *Why the ref diff is sound:* handlers mutate the Immer **draft**, never `appDb` — `produce` returns a structurally-shared new tree with fresh object references along every changed path (copy-on-write), while untouched keys keep their old references. So `old[k] !== new[k]` is exactly "the subtree under `k` changed" — the same guarantee react-redux selectors build on. It holds as long as all writes go through events; note this interacts with any future decision to disable `autoFreeze` in prod, since autoFreeze is what catches out-of-event mutations that neither refs nor patches would see.

- [ ] **Fix mount recompute cascades.**
  Every `computeValue` calls `ensureDirty`, re-dirtying the whole ancestor chain, and root reactions report `changed = true` unconditionally with a version bump (`src/reaction.ts`). Result: each newly mounting subscriber re-runs shared parent subs — mounting 100 rows with by-id subs over a sorted list costs ~100 sorts + 100 deep-equals of the list. By-id row subs are the *recommended* pattern, so this is a hot path. Roots should only bump versions when their slice actually changed; mounts should reuse clean cached values.

- [ ] **Revisit the default equality check.**
  Every computed sub gates with `fast-deep-equal` by default (`src/reaction.ts`, `src/settings.ts`) — O(result size) per node per touched root key. This is the part of re-frame that doesn't port: CLJS persistent-structure equality is cheap, JS deep-equal is not. Consider a cheaper default (shallow / `Object.is`) with opt-in deep, or at minimum document the cost prominently and recommend per-sub `equalityCheck` config for large derived collections.

- [ ] **Add `dispatchSync`.**
  Dispatch is always async (next-tick queue), so controlled inputs bound to db state are structurally impossible — the "keep input drafts in local `useState`" best practice is actually a hard constraint. re-frame ships `dispatch-sync` for exactly this (a reflex test even references it, but it doesn't exist in the API).

- [ ] **Background-tab flush fallback + flush-scheduling rework.**
  Subscription flushes go through `requestAnimationFrame` (`src/schedule.ts`), which doesn't fire in hidden tabs — db state keeps updating but subscriptions stall until the tab is visible. Add a visibility-aware fallback (e.g. `setTimeout` when `document.hidden`). Fold in the cross-subscription render-consistency fix (db generation counter — see P0 correctness note): both are properties of the same rAF-deferred flush design.

### P1 — Dev-mode strictness & navigation

- [ ] **Capture registration source location in dev mode.** *(pairs with devtools P2: handler locations)*
  At `regEvent`/`regSub`/`regEffect` time, capture file:line (synthetic `Error().stack`, dev-only, zero prod cost) and store it in the registrar. This is the last hop from runtime observation back to source code.

- [ ] **Fail loud on unregistered IDs in dev.**
  Dispatching a typo'd event or subscribing to a missing sub currently `console.error`s and continues. In dev mode, throw — and include a nearest-match suggestion ("did you mean `todos/add`?"). String IDs are only safe if mistakes surface immediately; this matters double for AI-generated code.

### P2

- [ ] **Static manifest generator.**
  A small CLI (`npx reflex-map`) that scans `regEvent`/`regSub`/`regEffect` calls and emits `APP_MAP.md`: id → file:line → params → effects emitted → sub dependency graph. Zero-drift documentation and the ideal first read for any agent session. If typed payload maps land, it can read signatures from the type map too.

- [ ] **Fix the `regEvent` overload heuristic.**
  `isCofxArray` (`src/events.ts`) distinguishes cofx from interceptors by inspecting `arr[0]`; an empty array is silently ambiguous and does nothing. A quiet failure mode worth eliminating.

- [ ] **Document positioning and constraints.**
  State openly in the README: client-rendered SPAs and React Native are the target; module-level singletons mean no SSR/RSC (cross-request leakage in Node), no multi-store; events are processed async; heavy reads over Immer drafts pay proxy overhead (use `current()` first). Zustand/Redux users will otherwise assume parity.

---

## Reflex DevTools + MCP (tools)

### P0

- [ ] **Make `dispatch_event` return its outcome.** *(pairs with lib P0: error tracing)*
  Currently `POST /api/dispatch` reports success before the handler runs — a typo'd event ID or a throwing handler both come back as "dispatched successfully." Have the client SDK report the resulting trace back over the WebSocket, and return patches + emitted effects (or the error) in the MCP tool response. This single change converts the MCP from "can poke the app" into a true REPL: action in, observed state-diff out, one round trip.

- [ ] **Two-tier trace access.**
  `get_traces` returns full tags — `patches`, `reversePatches`, and `effects` per event — up to 50 traces at a time: a context bomb on any real app. Make the list call return compact rows (id, operation, opType, duration, event args) and add a `get_trace(id)` detail tool. Drop `reversePatches` from MCP output entirely — agents never time-travel.

### P1

- [ ] **`find_state_changes(path)` tool.**
  The server already stores Immer patches per trace (`server/storage.ts`); index them by path and answer "which events wrote `todos.3.done`, in order?" server-side, returning `[{event, timestamp, patch}]`. This is *the* debugging question — answering it in one cheap call instead of having an agent scan fat traces is the biggest context-efficiency win available in the stack.

- [ ] **`sinceId` cursor on `get_traces`.**
  The dispatch→verify loop needs "everything that happened after my action." Limit-from-the-end is ambiguous under concurrent activity. Cheap to add; also the fallback verify mechanism until dispatch-returns-outcome ships.

### P2

- [ ] **Shape mode for `get_app_state`.**
  Add `depth` or `shape: true` returning keys + types + collection sizes — the runtime equivalent of reading `db.ts`, and the right first call on an unfamiliar large app. The current full dump is unusable there.

- [ ] **Source locations in `get_handlers`.** *(depends on lib P1: source capture)*
  Return file:line per handler id, so the agent goes from runtime observation to the exact source line with zero greps.

- [ ] **Security caveat in the README.**
  `/api/dispatch` mutates app state with no auth while `--host 0.0.0.0` is a documented option. One line: dev only, never expose beyond localhost/trusted networks.

## Feature parity: what to adopt from Redux (RTK) and Zustand

Legend: ✅ has it · ⚠️ partial / community · ❌ missing.

| Feature | Redux Toolkit | Zustand | Reflex today | Adopt? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concurrent-safe React binding (`useSyncExternalStore`) | ✅ react-redux v8+ | ✅ built on it | ✅ `useSyncExternalStore` | **Done** — stale params, missed render→subscribe updates, and per-sub tearing fixed; cross-sub render consistency remains a separate scheduler/generation task |
| Typed action/event payloads | ✅ `PayloadAction<T>` | ✅ typed store API | ✅ opt-in `EventPayloads`/`SubPayloads` maps | **Done** — typed dispatch/regEvent/useSubscription via module augmentation |
| Sync dispatch escape hatch | ✅ dispatch is sync | ✅ `set` is sync | ❌ async-only queue | **P1** — `dispatchSync` (re-frame parity; unblocks controlled inputs) |
| Undo / time-travel | ✅ DevTools time-travel | ⚠️ community (zundo) | ⚠️ patches + reversePatches already captured, unused | **P1** — built-in undo/redo effect is nearly free and a headline feature |
| Persistence + versioned migrations | ✅ redux-persist | ✅ `persist` middleware | ❌ hand-rolled storage effects | **P1** — official persist effect/interceptor with version migrations |
| Dev-mode invariant checks | ✅ serializability/immutability middleware, typo errors | ⚠️ | ⚠️ console warnings only, non-fatal | **P1** — fail-loud dev mode |
| Async data fetching & caching | ✅ RTK Query (dedup, invalidation, cache) | ❌ pair with TanStack Query | ❌ hand-rolled effects | **P1** standard `http` effect (retry/dedup); document TanStack Query pairing — a full RTK-Query-alike is not worth building yet |
| Per-call-site selector equality | ✅ `useSelector(sel, equalityFn)` | ✅ `shallow` / custom | ⚠️ per-sub config only | **P2** — options arg on `useSubscription` |
| Non-React (vanilla) subscriptions | ✅ `store.subscribe` | ✅ vanilla store | ⚠️ `Reaction.watch` internal only | **P2** — export a public `watchSubscription` for non-React consumers (services, headless logic) |
| Entity/normalization helpers | ✅ `createEntityAdapter` | ❌ | ❌ | **P2** — small helper package for id-keyed CRUD in `draftDb` |
| SSR / per-request stores | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ module-level singletons | **Decide** — either explicit non-goal (SPA/RN focus, document it) or a long-term instance-scoped rework |
| Code-split / lazy registration | ✅ `injectSlice` | ⚠️ manual | ✅ side-effect imports are naturally lazy | — already good |

Worth remembering the reverse direction too: the semantic event log, memoized subscription dependency graph, effects/coeffects isolation, first-class tracing, and the devtools MCP have no equivalent in either library — that's the moat these adoptions protect.

## If you only do four things

1. **`useSyncExternalStore` hook rewrite** (lib P0) — three correctness bugs, one fix; everything else assumes the binding can be trusted.
2. **`dispatch_event` returns outcome** (tools P0 + lib error tracing) — completes the agent loop.
3. **Typed payload maps** (lib P0) — closes the gap vs Redux Toolkit and adds the compiler to the agent's feedback loop.
4. **Two-tier traces** (tools P0) — makes runtime inspection affordable in tokens on a real-sized app.

Together these make the pitch airtight: indexed architecture (already there), a trustworthy React binding, compiler-checked wiring, and a runtime the agent can query and act on for less context than reading a single Redux slice.
